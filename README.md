I've used HTML(Hypertext Markup Languages) for content, and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
The freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification course is a great way to learn how to create responsive websites. This course covers all the basics of responsive web design, including how to use CSS media queries, flexbox, and grid. It also includes a project where you'll build a responsive portfolio website.

The course is project-based, which means that you'll learn by doing. You'll start by building a simple cat photo app, and then you'll gradually build more complex projects, such as a Twitter card with Flexbox and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

The course is also open-source, which means that you can contribute to it if you want. This is a great way to learn from other developers and to give back to the community.

If you're interested in learning how to create responsive websites, I highly recommend the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification course. It's a great way to learn the fundamentals of responsive web design and to build your portfolio.
